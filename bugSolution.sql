To fix the issue, rename the column 'order' to something that is not a SQL reserved keyword. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders RENAME COLUMN order TO order_number;

SELECT order_number FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 1;
```

**Addressing Other Uncommon SQL Errors:**

1. **Data Type Mismatch:**  Ensure all comparisons and calculations use compatible data types. Explicitly cast values when needed.

2. **Ambiguous Column Names:** Qualify ambiguous columns with the table name (e.g., `orders.order_number`)

3. **Incorrect JOIN Syntax:** Double-check join conditions and the type of JOIN clause you are using to ensure it retrieves the desired data.

4. **Subquery Errors:** Carefully review the logic of subqueries; if correlated, check if references are correct and the subquery's results are as expected.
