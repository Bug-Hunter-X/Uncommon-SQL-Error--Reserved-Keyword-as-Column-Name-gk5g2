The following SQL query attempts to use a reserved keyword as a column name.  This will result in a syntax error in most SQL databases.

```sql
SELECT order FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 1;
```

The `order` keyword is often reserved for ordering results using `ORDER BY`.

Other potential issues:

* **Incorrect Data Types:** Using incompatible data types in comparisons or calculations. For instance, trying to compare a string with a number directly.
* **Ambiguous Column Names:** If you have multiple tables joined, having columns with the same name can lead to ambiguous references.
* **Incorrect JOIN Syntax:**  Using the wrong join conditions or types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) can yield incorrect results.
* **Subquery Errors:** Issues such as a correlated subquery not properly returning expected data due to incorrect referencing.
